✅ Activities Completed

Completed Bank System scenario-based problem

Completed Utility (Math Operations) scenario-based problem

Learned and practiced:

static

sealed

is operator

##  🏦 Bank System – Features (5 Points)

Stores bank and branch details using classes

Separates manager and user operations

Allows customer account creation and viewing details

Uses menu-driven structure for interaction

Applies OOP concepts like constructors and access modifiers

##  🔢 Math Utility Program – Features (5 Points)

Calculates factorial with negative number validation

Checks whether a number is prime

Finds GCD using the Euclidean algorithm

Computes nᵗʰ Fibonacci number iteratively

Uses menu-driven program with reusable static methods

## 🧠 Concepts Learned (Brief)
🔹 static

Belongs to the class, not objects

Accessed without creating an instance

Used for utility methods

🔹 sealed

Prevents a class from being inherited

Used to restrict further extension

Improves security and design control

🔹 is Operator

Used to check object type at runtime

Returns true or false

Helps in safe type checking
